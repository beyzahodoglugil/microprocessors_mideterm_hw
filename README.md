# Dot Matrix Display Control

A program that writes text and simple graphics to an 8x8 dot matrix screen.It is a program written in assembly language that asks the user to enter text or graphical data.

This project is a Microprocessors Course Project (P2) of these students from Cukurova University for Assoc. Prof. Dr. Mustafa Berkan BİÇER's course:Gizem Ezer, İrem Sude Mirik, Fidan Ezgi Çoban, Naciye Beyza Hodoğlugil.

# Problem Definition

Our aim with this project was to design a program that writes the text and graphic data we receive from the user to an 8x8 dot matrix screen.The program we aim to design will first find the ASCII code equivalent of the text data received from the user and integrate it into the 8x8 dot matrix. Then, this text data will be printed on the screen with the help of the emulation kit.

# The Procedure

First, we determined the purpose of the project with our teammates. Then, we decided what path we would follow, determined the steps we would take, and distributed the tasks among us. We did detailed research for these steps. We encountered some problems in the program we completed. We discussed the emerging problems among ourselves and tried to find solutions. However, we failed in some steps and could not find solutions to all the problems.
